# Overnight — Autonomous Work Session

Long-running session where you interview the user for priorities, then work autonomously for hours. Delegate heavily to sub-agents. Document everything. Produce a comprehensive summary.

**CRITICAL: This skill requires ZERO user input after the interview phase.** You must make all decisions autonomously and never pause for permission or approval. If you encounter a permission prompt or need to ask the user something after kickoff, you've broken the contract.

## Phases

```
INTERVIEW → PLAN → EXECUTE → CONSOLIDATE → SUMMARIZE
```

---

## Phase 1: INTERVIEW (Interactive)

This is the only interactive phase. Go back and forth with the user to define the session's work.

**Ask about:**
- **Priorities** — What are the 2-4 most important things to tackle?
- **Focus areas** — Backend? Frontend? New features? Bug fixes? Polish?
- **Taste questions** — Design direction, UX preferences, behavior edge cases
- **Constraints** — Anything off-limits? Anything that must not change?
- **Skill routing** — Should any work use `/ideate` for spec docs? `/senior-review` for quality?
- **Depth vs breadth** — Deep on fewer items, or broad coverage?

**Keep interviewing until:**
- You have enough work to fill a multi-hour autonomous session
- All open questions about direction, taste, and behavior are answered
- You understand priorities well enough to make autonomous decisions

**Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the user explicitly says to kick it off** (e.g., "go", "start", "kick it off", "goodnight"). The transition from interactive to autonomous must be clear.

---

## Autonomous Execution Mode

**After the user says "go" / "start" / "kick it off":**

1. **NEVER ask the user a question** — Make all decisions yourself
2. **NEVER pause for permission** — All tool usage should be pre-approved or auto-approved
3. **NEVER use AskUserQuestion** — Document your decisions instead
4. **NEVER wait for approval** — Edit files, run bash commands, create files freely
5. **NEVER present options for the user to choose** — Pick the best option and document why

**If you find yourself needing user input:**
- You either didn't interview thoroughly enough (go back and ask before kickoff)
- OR you should make a judgment call and document it in the summary

**Tool execution:**
- All tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task, Skill, TodoWrite) should execute without permission prompts
- If a permission prompt appears, something is wrong with the execution environment
- Make the best call you can and document that you needed manual approval

**The contract:** Once the user says "go", they trust you to work for hours without checking in. Don't break that trust by asking questions mid-execution.

---

## Phase 2: PLAN (Autonomous from here)

From this point on: **NEVER ask the user a question.** Make your best judgment call and document the decision.

1. Create a task list of all work items, ordered by priority
2. Decompose large items into independent sub-tasks
3. Identify which tasks can run in parallel vs sequentially
4. Map each task to a delegation strategy:

| Work Type | Delegation |
|-----------|------------|
| Feature spec/design | `/ideate` via Skill tool or Task (general-purpose) |
| Code quality/cleanup | `/senior-review` via Skill tool |
| Bug investigation | Task (Explore agent) |
| Implementation | Write code directly or Task (general-purpose) |
| Research/exploration | Task (Explore agent) |
| Deep analysis | Task (general-purpose) |

---

## Phase 3: EXECUTE (Autonomous)

Work through the task list. Delegate aggressively to sub-agents to preserve main context for orchestration.

### Test As You Build

**CRITICAL: Test every feature locally before moving to the next task.** Don't batch testing at the end — bugs compound and become harder to diagnose.

For every feature or fix you ship:
1. **Start the server** if not already running (`python3 app.py` in backend dir)
2. **Hit the relevant API endpoints** with curl to verify data flows correctly
3. **Check for regressions** — did your change break anything adjacent?
4. **Fix bugs immediately** — don't document them for later, fix them now
5. **Log what you tested** — note in your progress tracking what you verified

```
Build feature → Test locally → Fix bugs → Verify fix → Move to next task
```

**API testing pattern:**
```bash
# Always verify your changes work with real data
curl -s "http://localhost:5001/api/league/17810260/week/5/deep-dive?year=2025&team_id=1" | python3 -m json.tool
```

**If a test reveals a bug:**
- Fix it immediately (don't add to "bugs found" and move on)
- Re-test after the fix
- Document the bug + fix in your progress notes (good content for the summary)

**If a test reveals a deployment concern:**
- Check that requirements.txt (root level) includes any new dependencies
- Verify the change works with the production config (Railway reads root requirements.txt, not backend/)

### Sub-Agent Delegation

**Launch in parallel where tasks are independent:**
```
// Single message, multiple Task calls
Task({ subagent_type: "Explore", prompt: "...", description: "Research A" })
Task({ subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "...", description: "Build B" })
```

**What to delegate:**
- Large codebase searches → Explore agent
- Multi-file reading/analysis → general-purpose agent
- Implementation of well-defined features → general-purpose agent
- Research questions → Explore agent

**What to do directly:**
- Small edits (< 3 files)
- Documentation updates
- Task orchestration and progress tracking
- Reading sub-agent outputs and deciding next steps

### Decision-Making Protocol

When facing a design, architecture, or direction decision:
1. Make your best call based on the interview context and project patterns
2. **Document the decision immediately** — what you chose, why, and what the alternative was
3. If the decision is high-risk or easily reversible later, note that too
4. Continue working — don't block on decisions

### Progress Tracking

- Use TodoWrite to track all tasks
- Mark tasks complete as they finish
- If a task raises open questions for the user, note them and move on (add to "Open Questions" in summary)
- If a task is blocked and can't be unblocked autonomously, document and skip
- **Never pause to ask the user for clarification** — make your best call and document it

### Handling Permission Prompts

If you encounter a permission prompt during autonomous execution:
1. **This should not happen** — the user expects zero interruptions
2. **Document it** — note in your summary that you needed manual approval for [specific tool/action]
3. **Suggest a fix** — if you know why the prompt appeared, recommend how to prevent it next time
4. **Continue autonomously** — once approved, don't ask again for similar actions

### Force-Stop Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Same error 3+ times | Document, move to next task |
| Critical ambiguity blocking all remaining work | Document, proceed to summarize |
| All tasks complete | Proceed to consolidate |
| Diminishing returns (spinning wheels) | Document, proceed to consolidate |

---

## Phase 4: CONSOLIDATE (Autonomous)

After execution is complete (or force-stopped):

1. Read all sub-agent outputs
2. Verify changes work together (no conflicts, broken references)
3. **Run a final round of local testing** — start the server, hit key endpoints, verify nothing is broken
4. **Run `/senior-review`** on the scope of your changes to catch bugs, clean up code, and polish before the user sees it
5. **Update all project documentation:**
   - CLAUDE.md — new files, endpoints, structure changes
   - ROADMAP.md — completed items, new items discovered
   - MEETING_NOTES.md — comprehensive entry for this session
6. **Verify deployment readiness:**
   - Root `requirements.txt` includes all new dependencies (Railway reads this, not backend/)
   - No hardcoded localhost URLs in production-facing code
   - Environment variables documented if any new ones are needed
7. Commit all changes with a clear commit message

**Important:** If you shipped frontend changes, note in your summary that the user should run `/test` to validate the UI works in a browser before considering the feature fully shipped. You can verify APIs and backend logic autonomously, but browser testing requires manual validation.

## Phase 5: SUMMARIZE (Autonomous)

Generate a numbered summary doc in `dev/overnight-summaries/`.

Check existing files to determine the next number. Format: `NNN-YYYY-MM-DD-focus-area.md`

### Summary Doc Format

```markdown

## Context Preservation Rules

Your main context window is precious during a long session. Protect it.

| Action | How | Why |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Research codebase | Task (Explore) | Keeps raw search results in sub-agent |
| Build features | Task (general-purpose) | Implementation details stay in sub-agent |
| Read sub-agent results | Read tool on output | Only pull summaries into main context |
| Track progress | TodoWrite | Lightweight, stays in main |
| Quick edits | Edit/Write directly | Fast, minimal context cost |

**Rule of thumb:** If it involves reading more than 3 files or writing more than 50 lines, delegate it.

---

## Guidelines

- **Bias toward action.** When in doubt, build it and document the decision.
- **Ship > perfect.** Get features working, note polish items for later.
- **Document decisions in real-time.** Don't batch them for the summary — you might forget context.
- **Update `planning/MEETING_NOTES.md` before the summary.** The summary is for the user's morning review; meeting notes are the permanent record.
- **Don't gold-plate.** If a task is done enough to work, mark it complete and move on.
- **Respect the interview.** The user's priorities from Phase 1 are gospel. Don't go rogue on scope.
